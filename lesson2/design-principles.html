            <p> Alignment: This creates order within the design and guides the viewer’s eye around the page. Based on
                Gutenberg’s diagram, which states a viewer skims the page in a Z-pattern, the most important information
                should be placed in the upper left and the bottom right hand corner.

            <h2>Booking</h2>

            <p> Booking.com gets right to the point on their mobile homepage which allows the user to easily begin
                searching for a hotel or room in your specified area. By choosing yellow as the background color, the
                user's attention is immediately drawn to the form with a clear call-to-action at the bottom of the
                section<br/>
                The search itself is about as detailed as you would expect but in a very functional mobile format. Each
                hotel includes pictures, ratings, and pricing information. There's even a sorting option to further
                narrow down what you’re looking for.<br/>
                Once you click on one of the choices, you are met with more extensive details about the location and
                options to change any of the information you initially searched with. To create further incentive to
                buy, there's a small red bubble that tells you if others are also looking at the same hotel.<br/>
                The amount of information that booking.com was able to pack into theirs sites mobile web design without
                sacrificing its visual appeal is extremely impressive.

            <h2>Adidas</h2>

            <p>Adidas’s mobile web design includes a variety of the elements already mentioned here but does so in such
                a way that mimics their desktop website. The banner ads include engaging images that contain large
                buttons that link to current promotions or specific product information. Adidas has a nice balance of
                interesting content and simplistic design which makes their homepage very clean.<br/>
                Adidas also does a nice job of extending their home page to include product categories users can filter
                through. Rather than using the mobile menu, you can search for a specific product category right on the
                home page to get you to the product you want quicker.<br/>
                Like Abercrombie, the site also allows vibrant images to attract the user's eyes on their product pages
                and the most attention is brought to their large “Add to Bag” button to get users to purchase their
                products.
