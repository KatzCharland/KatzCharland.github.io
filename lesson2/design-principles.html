            <p> Alignment: This creates order within the design and guides the viewer's eye around the page. Based on
                Gutenberg's diagram, which states a viewer skims the page in a Z-pattern, the most important information 
                should be placed in the upper left and the bottom right hand corner.

            <h2>Booking</h2>

            <p> Booking.com gets right to the point on their mobile homepage which allows the user to easily begin 
                searching for a hotel or room in your specified area. By choosing yellow as the background color, the
                user's attention is immediately drawn to the form with a clear call-to-action at the bottom of the section. 
                The search itself is about as detailed as you would expect but in a very functional mobile format. Each hotel
                includes pictures, ratings, and pricing information. There's even a sorting option to further narrow down 
                what you're looking for.
                Once you click on one of the choices, you are met with more extensive details about the location and options
                to change any of the information you initially searched with. To create further incentive to buy, there's 
                a small red bubble that tells you if others are also looking at the same hotel.
                The amount of information that booking.com wasa able to pack into their sites mobile web design without
                sacrificing its visual appeal is extremely impressive.

            <h2>Adidas</h2>

            <p>Adidas's mobile web design includes a variety of the elements already mentioned here but does so in such
                a way that mimics their desktop website. The banner ads include engaging images that contain large buttons
                that link to current promotions or specific product information. Adidas has a nice balance of interesting
                content and simplistic design which makes their homepage very clean.
                Adidas also does a nice job of extending their homepage to include product categories users can filter through.
                Rather than using the mobile menu, you can search for a specific product category right on the homepage to get 
                you to the product you want quicker. 
                Like Abercrombe, the site also allows vibrant images to attract the user's eyes on their product pages and the
                most attention is brought to their large "Add to Bag" button to get users to purchase their products.
